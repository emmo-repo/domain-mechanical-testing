# What is a Domain level  Ontology
Domain ontologies reuse or specialise concepts from the middle and top level EMMO and specify terms and relationships that are relevant in a domain. A Domain is a particular area of interest, such as a branch of science and technology, e.g. organic chemistry, mechanics, electronics etc.
