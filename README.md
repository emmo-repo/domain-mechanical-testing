# Domain: mechanical-testing
A domain ontology for mechanical testing based on EMMO. 
# Status: 
- [ ] Proposal
- [X] accepted, under development
- [ ] official 
This domain ontology is a WIP, it is in the process of being accepted as a task group by the EMMC. 
* Application submitted: 15 June 2020 
* Application accepted on: TBD
# What is a Domain level  Ontology
Domain ontologies reuse or specialise concepts from the middle and top level EMMO and specify terms and relationships that are relevant in a domain. A Domain is a particular area of interest, such as a branch of science and technology, e.g. organic chemistry, mechanics, electronics etc.

Please refer to the Governance document of up to date information: https://github.com/emmo-repo/EMMO/blob/1.0.0-alpha2/doc/EMMO_governance.md

# Requirements
The Mechanical Testing ontology is built on top of EMMO. The following table describes the version compatibility between imported ontologies.

| Ontology            | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Mechanical Testing  | 0.9.0             |
| EMMO                | 1.0.0-beta4       |
